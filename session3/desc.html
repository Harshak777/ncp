<h2>objective</h2>
<p>To understand the behaviour of dogs</p>
<h2>description</h2>
<p>A dog will have all of the basic emotions: joy, fear, anger, disgust, and, yes, love, but the dog does not experience the more complex emotions like guilt, pride, and shame. Many would argue that they have seen evidence indicating their dog is capable of experiencing guilt.</p>
<p>Many would argue that they have seen evidence indicating their dog is capable of experiencing guilt.</p>
<p>The usual situation recounted is one in which youâ€™ve come home and your dog starts slinking around showing discomfort, and you then find that he has left a smelly brown deposit on your kitchen floor. It is natural to conclude that the dog was acting in a way that shows that he is feeling guilty about his transgression</p>
<p>Despite appearances, this is not guilt, but simply a display of the more basic emotion of fear. Your dog has learned that when you appear and his droppings are visible on the floor, bad things happen to him. What you see is his fear of punishment; he will never feel guilt because he is not capable of experiencing it.</p>
